        <h3>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars - A world of Luxury</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is renowned for their cars that are considered to be the pinnacle of luxury.

            This luxury is illustrated with their Phantom class which is currently in their 8th generation.

            Founded by Charles Rolls and Henry Royce, their story started in 1904 with a collective vision to make not one of the best but the best car. 

            In this spotlight, we're going to explore their story and the cars which illustrate these principles and continue to push the boundaries of luxury.

        <h3>When Rolls met Royce</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charles Rolls first met Henry Royce when he owned a car dealership.

                Completely captivated by Royce's car, Charles wanted to sell as many of the 10hp cars as he could but under the marque of Rolls-Royce. 

                With the partnership agreed, Rolls-Royce was born.

                Claude Johnson, regarded as the hyphen in Rolls-Royce, was the new MD and spearheaded the marketing by coming up with slogans like "Not one of the best, but the best car in the World".

                It wasn't long before they started delivering on this promise.

            <h3>Rolls-Royce - Record Breakers</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1907, Rolls-Royce started to deliver on their promise and laid a marker for endurance and reliability with the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost.

                This car smashed records when it travelled from London to Glasgow 27-times and covered 14,371 miles!

                Selling over 7,500 units, the Silver Ghost was phased out in 1925. What replaced this popular model was the Phantom 1. Now part of a dynasty, it illustrates Rolls-Royce's endeavour to make the best car.
